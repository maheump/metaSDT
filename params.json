{"name":"metaSDT","tagline":"Individual signal detection analysis for type II data.","body":"### Description.\r\nmetaSDT is a R function analyzing your type II data with signal detection theory. It works with confidence ratings (any type of scale with 1 step between two grades) and control levels (such as information seeking level or amount of exploration).\r\n\r\n### Input.\r\nIt only requires:\r\n* an \"input_data\" data.frame with answers labels in the first column and confidence ratings in the second one,\r\n* and confidence borns.\r\n\r\nIt can also take into account design (detection or choice), ponderation type, and homogeneity analysis, which are specified by default.\r\n\r\n### Answers labels.\r\nAnswers have to be classified (answers labels) following classical SDT categories:\r\n* 1: Hit,\r\n* 2: False alarm,\r\n* 3: Miss,\r\n* 4: Correct rejection.\r\n\r\n### Utilization.\r\n* Open R.\r\n* Set the working directory to the right place.\r\n```\r\nsetwd(\"~/Documents/R/metaSDT\")\r\n```\r\n* Load the function.\r\n```\r\nsource(\"MM_metaSDT.r\")\r\n```\r\n* Load the example data.\r\n```\r\ndata <- read.csv(\"example_data.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \";\")\r\n```\r\n* Launch the function.\r\n```\r\nMM_metaSDT(data, 1, 6)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### References.\r\nHere are some usefull references to undestand what is going on here :\r\n* Fleming, S.
